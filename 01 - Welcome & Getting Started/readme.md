##  .net team came up with  a new architecture wich was .net MVC
![netcore](img/roadmap.png) \
it was created on top of the components of web forms becauss of it was tightly tied to IIS and ultimately windows operating system.\
As a result of that In june of 2016 Microsoft released ASP .net core  and it was the first version of .net that was built on top of this new.\

.net core platforn has been completely rewritten and it is a cross platform version. because of that it is not tied to windows os\
it was written with cloud architecture in mind that is exttemly robust\
then in aug 0f 2018 MS released the next version of .net core which is .net core 2.0 

## Is there a reason to use .net core instead of classic .net?
